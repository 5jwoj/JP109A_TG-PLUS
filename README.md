This is a tutorial to install and use the enhanced MOD for javplayer 109a, enhance the effect after removing mosaic.
This MOD was created by the Discord community kmkii#8701.<BR>
If you can run the original javplayer, the mod should be easy to run as well.<BR>

Do not use it for any commercial purposes.</strong><BR></pre>
