</pre>

## Installation Instructions:
<pre>
1. The runtime environment is cuda 11.3.1 cudnn-11.3 v8.2.1.32, Please install and configure it.
2. Unzip zipfile to JavPlayer_109a/TG/ directory, copy ConfigTools.exe to the same directory as javplayer.exe.
3. Configuration file Config.ini will auto-generated on first run.
4. Optional Topaz Video Enhance AI, Use the default installation path to get veai parameters. 
   If installed elsewhere please specify the directory where veai is located in config.ini or use ConfigTools. 
   Unfortunately the CLI has been removed from 2.4.0. So please wait for the veai update or continue with 2.3.0.

2. Update model SE-4X-S1, sharper comparison with SE-4X.
3. NEW ue-model UE-4X, for detail enhancement of effects after SE or veai.
  The usual usage. 
   a. tg-se-ue 
   b. tg-veai-ue 
   c. tg-se-veai-ue 
  Note:  
   After tg-se-veai multiple upscales, the UE should be preceded by a downscale:4, to prevent out-of-memory errors.
